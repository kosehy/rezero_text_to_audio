## Introduction  
As a HackHighSchool mentor I need to establish expertise in the same language(in this case, Python!) and or framework that I will be mentoring.
This project's mition is to build a side project of my own invention and make a nicely documented Github repository for my portfolio.
#### About This Project
What is TTS?
TTS(Text to speech) is a form of speech synthesis that converts text into spoken voice output.

#### About Me
Developer, Designer Be creative!! Currently Studying [@42SiliconValley][42]
#### About 42  
[42][42] is a free, non profit, project-based, peer-to-peer learning coding school. It originated in France and now has over 20 campuses all over the world. More information can be found [here][42] 
## Objective  
To learn about making python program and using google tts to make speech file from text file.
## Instructions
Make sure you have the needed [dependencies](#dependencies) before proceeding.
For instructions and/or greater detail refer to the instruction.ipynb
## Mandatory part
- [ ] Upload to Vogsphere a link to your public facing Github repository.
- [ ] The project code should run without errors and perform an interesting or useful task. It should handle bad input gracefully.
- [ ] The user interaction part of your program should be well explained or easy to understand.
- [ ] Your README should explain the purpose and/or use of the program, and include screenshots of it running.
- [ ] Your README should contain full instructions for installing and running the pro-gram on a blank MacOS system.  Use a guest account on the HackHighSchool check-in computers for testing.
- [ ] Your Github repo should specify the license that clarifies what permissions you give for others to modify and reuse your work.
- [ ] There should be no unnecessary files in your Github repo that distract from the real content, or any that reveal secrets such as API keys.
- [ ] Each file containing code should start with a header block that introduces the origin and purpose of the code.
- [ ] Your code should be nicely formatted, and code/function/class/filenames should contribute to its overall readability.
- [ ] You should make multiple commits to your Github repository over the course ofthe project, and your commit messages should be dignified and descriptive.
- [ ] You should work socially to some extent by discussing your project with othercadets, whether it be to ask for advice or to show off your work.
## Bonus part
- [ ] Create a new git branch every time you start working on a new feature, and then merge it into the master branch when done.
- [ ] Make the program look beautiful with great front-end design or terminal colors and formatting.
- [ ] For maximum credit, add 5 additional "features" or improvements on top of the bare mininum functioning program.
- [ ] Use the gaming computers at the back of Zone 3 to ensure that your setup instructions also work on a guest account of a Windows operating system.

### Warning For 42 Students

This is not kept up to date and I cannot guarantee that it will work on your future machines. You are welcome to use and learn from this as you want, but do not implement code that you do not understand. Copying is not the way.
